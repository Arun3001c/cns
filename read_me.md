to start this project you need a server so for this you need to use the node or python for server or you can use vs code live servers 

actually created the 2 seperate .bat files to run this program where it runs this project with
Option A: Use Python 3
cd path/to/project
python -m http.server
Then open: http://localhost:8000

Option B: Use Node.js
npx serve .
Then open: http://localhost:3000


python -m http.server
🔍 What It Means (in parts):
python → You're invoking the Python interpreter (must be installed).

-m → This flag tells Python to run a module as a script.

http.server → This is a built-in Python module that starts a simple web server.

🔧 What It Does:
This command starts a basic HTTP server that serves files in the current directory over the web.

By default, it runs on port 8000.


http://localhost:8000/
🌍 Why This Helps:
When you open index.html directly (like file:///...), ES6 modules (import ...) get blocked by the browser.

But when served via http://localhost:8000, it behaves like a normal web server — so the browser allows module imports.

🧪 Example:
You're in the folder:

makefile
Copy
Edit
D:\projects\platformer-game
Then you run:
cd D:\projects\platformer-game
python -m http.server
Then open your browser:
http://localhost:8000/index.html
✅ Your Kaboom.js or JS module game will run correctly.

🛠 Optional:
Want to change the port?

python -m http.server 3000
Now it's available at:

http://localhost:3000/


how to create a .bat file that will launch your game in the browser and start the server with one click:

✅ 1. Create the .bat File
📝 Contents of run_game.bat:

@echo off
cd /d "D:\projects\college\PlatformerGame"
start http://localhost:8000/index.html
py -m http.server
🔧 What It Does:
cd /d → changes to your game folder (including switching drives if needed).

start http://localhost:8000/index.html → opens your game in the default browser.

py -m http.server → starts the Python web server.

✅ 2. Save It:
Open Notepad.

Paste the above code.

Save as:

run_game.bat
Choose Save as type: All Files
and place it inside or outside your project directory (up to you).

🚀 To Run:
Just double-click run_game.bat → Your game will:

Open in the browser

Start the local server


Optional: Create a .bat File for npx serve
If you prefer Node over Python, here's a .bat version:

run_with_npx.bat:


@echo off
cd /d "D:\projects\college\PlatformerGame"
start http://localhost:3000/index.html
npx serve .

or 
If you install serve globally, you can use it in an npm script inside your project, which gives you a clean and consistent way to launch the server.
npm install -g serve
